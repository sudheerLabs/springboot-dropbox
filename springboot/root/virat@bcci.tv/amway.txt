if we are serious about this, we can make it a success.
Even they are financially broke, they are success.
Introverts can be successful.
Dont let the course throw you off the track.

How much support their team, downline and upline, provided them.

Went through the CD: Financial Stability in the 21st century by Greg Duncan

Questions you need to ask yourself:

Why do you do, what you are doing, to make a living?

If you give 8 hours for your boss business, can you give 2 hours for your business in a day?

How long are you going to wait to live the life you deserve rather than the life you are forced to live?



Some of the Gems in the CD:
Stop asking wrong questions.

Get control of your life, not in terms of money but time.

Once you know the opportunity that will get you free, you have responsibility to take it.

The greatest risk in live is to risk nothing.

If you dont pursue excellence, mediocrity will pursue you.

If you treat your goals and life casually, you will be a casualty.

The greatest charity in the world is to eliminate the need for charity by teaching self sufficiency.
